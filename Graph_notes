Changing the default text color of the graph:

  -Chart.defaults.global.defaultFontColor = 'white';

Making a Gradient:

  -if you have the line:
      var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
  then you can use this to make a gradient:
      var gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(x0,y0,x1,y1);
      gradient.addColorStop(0, 'color');
      gradient.addColorStop(1, 'color');
  -The four arguments that are passed into the createLinearGradient method are the initial x and y coordinates
  followed by the final x and y coordinates. 
  -the two arguments passed into the addColorStop method are the position that you want the stop at between 
  the initial and final points (from 0-1) and the color you want at that point.
